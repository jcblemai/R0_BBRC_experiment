  abstract  = {Many scientific challenges involve the study of stochastic dynamic systems for which only noisy or incomplete measurements are available. Inference for partially observed Markov process models provides a framework for formulating and answering questions about these systems. Except when the system is small, or approximately linear and Gaussian, state-of-the-art statistical methods are required to make efficient use of available data. Evaluation of the likelihood for a partially observed Markov process model can be formulated as a filtering problem. Iterated filtering algorithms carry out repeated Monte Carlo filtering operations to maximize the likelihood. We develop a new theoretical framework for iterated filtering and construct a new algorithm that dramatically outperforms previous approaches on a challenging inference problem in disease ecology.Iterated filtering algorithms are stochastic optimization procedures for latent variable models that recursively combine parameter perturbations with latent variable reconstruction. Previously, theoretical support for these algorithms has been based on the use of conditional moments of perturbed parameters to approximate derivatives of the log likelihood function. Here, a theoretical approach is introduced based on the convergence of an iterated Bayes map. An algorithm supported by this theory displays substantial numerical improvement on the computational challenge of inferring parameters of a partially observed Markov process.},

  abstract  = {Author summary As our world becomes more and more globalized, infectious disease poses an ever-increasing threat to human health. The multitude of environmental and behavioral factors, which account for the spread of infectious diseases, are ever-evolving and thus infectious diseases propagation is complex. In the face of this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools to study the dynamics of epidemic diseases. Developing adequate statistical and mathematical tools, that take account of the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms responsible for disease propagation, remains a major challenge. To take this increasingly important aspect into consideration, we propose a flexible methodology that encompasses time-varying aspects of the epidemic. It does this via diffusion process equations for time-varying parameters. Considering the relative paucity of available data, our principal assertion is that it is preferable to use this flexible framework with time-varying parameters, that tracks epidemiological patterns, and updates the key parameters according to data, than to use a more complex model.},
